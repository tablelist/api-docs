# Authentication

The Tablelist API uses API keys for authentication.

Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.

To use your API keys you'll need to send to `api-key` header on every request.

All API requests must be made over HTTPS. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
